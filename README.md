<header><b>DNA Super Decoder</b></header>
<p>A simple program that takes in DNA strands and outputs proteins/mRNA strands</p>

<header><b>USAGE</b></header>
<p>1. Download the python file (DNAreader.py)</p>
<p>2. Run the .py file on a python interperter. This doesn't need to support any special features, but I'd reccommend running on windows. </p>
<p>3. Type in characters to represent the DNA base pairs (ATCG). The DNA must be a length of 3, 6, 9 etc. </p>
<p>4. Wait for the DNA to process. You can then see the matching mRNA and protein/gene that is decoded. </p>
<p>5. Rinse, repeat. It's not rocket science. </p>

<p>This is dedicated to my science teacher, ____. Without ____, I wouldn't know what I do. Thanks!</p>
<p>Also for my father. Hope you like it Dad!</p>
